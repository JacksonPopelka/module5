matplotlib module 5

Sorry for the short readme, been a super long week working and I dont have much longer to turn it in. 

In this module we will be going over data from the company we just joined pymaceuticals, inc. 

We went through and prepared our data by counting, combining, and merging. 

We then generated our summary statistics that we will use in our charts and graphs 

After this we then used our data to put them into various graphs, charts, and plots.

we finalized the study showing the correlation between mouse weight and the average tumor being 0.84
